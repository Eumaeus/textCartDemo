urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.1.1#Achilles' wrath, to Greece the direful spring
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.1.2#Of woes unnumber'd, heavenly goddess, sing!
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.1.3#That wrath which hurl'd to Pluto's gloomy reign
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.1.4#The souls of mighty chiefs untimely slain;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.1.5#Whose limbs unburied on the naked shore,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.1.6#Devouring dogs and hungry vultures tore.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.1.7#Since great Achilles and Atrides strove,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.1.8#Such was the sovereign doom, and such the will of Jove!
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.2.1#Declare, O Muse! in what ill-fated hour
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.2.2#Sprung the fierce strife, from what offended power
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.2.3#Latona's son a dire contagion spread,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.2.4#And heap'd the camp with mountains of the dead;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.2.5#The king of men his reverent priest defied,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.2.6#And for the king's offence the people died.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.3.1#For Chryses sought with costly gifts to gain
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.3.2#His captive daughter from the victor's chain.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.3.3#Suppliant the venerable father stands;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.3.4#Apollo's awful ensigns grace his hands
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.3.5#By these he begs; and lowly bending down,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.3.6#Extends the sceptre and the laurel crown
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.3.7#He sued to all, but chief implored for grace
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.3.8#The brother-kings, of Atreus' royal race
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.4.1#"Ye kings and warriors! may your vows be crown'd,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.4.2#And Troy's proud walls lie level with the ground.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.4.3#May Jove restore you when your toils are o'er
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.4.4#Safe to the pleasures of your native shore.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.4.5#But, oh! relieve a wretched parent's pain,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.4.6#And give Chryseis to these arms again;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.4.7#If mercy fail, yet let my presents move,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.4.8#And dread avenging Phoebus, son of Jove."
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.5.1#The Greeks in shouts their joint assent declare,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.5.2#The priest to reverence, and release the fair.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.5.3#Not so Atrides; he, with kingly pride,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.5.4#Repulsed the sacred sire, and thus replied:
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.6.1#"Hence on thy life, and fly these hostile plains,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.6.2#Nor ask, presumptuous, what the king detains
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.6.3#Hence, with thy laurel crown, and golden rod,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.6.4#Nor trust too far those ensigns of thy god.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.6.5#Mine is thy daughter, priest, and shall remain;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.6.6#And prayers, and tears, and bribes, shall plead in vain;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.6.7#Till time shall rifle every youthful grace,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.6.8#And age dismiss her from my cold embrace,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.6.9#In daily labours of the loom employ'd,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.6.10#Or doom'd to deck the bed she once enjoy'd
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.6.11#Hence then; to Argos shall the maid retire,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.6.12#Far from her native soil and weeping sire."
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.7.1#The trembling priest along the shore return'd,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.7.2#And in the anguish of a father mourn'd.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.7.3#Disconsolate, not daring to complain,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.7.4#Silent he wander'd by the sounding main;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.7.5#Till, safe at distance, to his god he prays,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.7.6#The god who darts around the world his rays.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.8.1#"O Smintheus! sprung from fair Latona's line,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.8.2#Thou guardian power of Cilla the divine,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.8.3#Thou source of light! whom Tenedos adores,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.8.4#And whose bright presence gilds thy Chrysa's shores.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.8.5#If e'er with wreaths I hung thy sacred fane,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.8.6#Or fed the flames with fat of oxen slain;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.8.7#God of the silver bow! thy shafts employ,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.8.8#Avenge thy servant, and the Greeks destroy."
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.9.1#Thus Chryses pray'd.--the favouring power attends,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.9.2#And from Olympus' lofty tops descends.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.9.3#Bent was his bow, the Grecian hearts to wound;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.9.4#Fierce as he moved, his silver shafts resound.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.9.5#Breathing revenge, a sudden night he spread,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.9.6#And gloomy darkness roll'd about his head.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.9.7#The fleet in view, he twang'd his deadly bow,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.9.8#And hissing fly the feather'd fates below.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.9.9#On mules and dogs the infection first began;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.9.10#And last, the vengeful arrows fix'd in man.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.9.11#For nine long nights, through all the dusky air,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.9.12#The pyres, thick-flaming, shot a dismal glare.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.9.13#But ere the tenth revolving day was run,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.9.14#Inspired by Juno, Thetis' godlike son
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.9.15#Convened to council all the Grecian train;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.9.16#For much the goddess mourn'd her heroes slain.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.9.17#The assembly seated, rising o'er the rest,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.9.18#Achilles thus the king of men address'd:
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.10.1#"Why leave we not the fatal Trojan shore,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.10.2#And measure back the seas we cross'd before?
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.10.3#The plague destroying whom the sword would spare,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.10.4#'Tis time to save the few remains of war.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.10.5#But let some prophet, or some sacred sage,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.10.6#Explore the cause of great Apollo's rage;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.10.7#Or learn the wasteful vengeance to remove
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.10.8#By mystic dreams, for dreams descend from Jove.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.10.9#If broken vows this heavy curse have laid,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.10.10#Let altars smoke, and hecatombs be paid.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.10.11#So Heaven, atoned, shall dying Greece restore,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.10.12#And Phoebus dart his burning shafts no more."
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.11.1#He said, and sat: when Chalcas thus replied;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.11.2#Chalcas the wise, the Grecian priest and guide,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.11.3#That sacred seer, whose comprehensive view,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.11.4#The past, the present, and the future knew:
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.11.5#Uprising slow, the venerable sage
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.11.6#Thus spoke the prudence and the fears of age:
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.12.1#"Beloved of Jove, Achilles! would'st thou know
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.12.2#Why angry Phoebus bends his fatal bow?
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.12.3#First give thy faith, and plight a prince's word
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.12.4#Of sure protection, by thy power and sword:
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.12.5#For I must speak what wisdom would conceal,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.12.6#And truths, invidious to the great, reveal,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.12.7#Bold is the task, when subjects, grown too wise,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.12.8#Instruct a monarch where his error lies;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.12.9#For though we deem the short-lived fury past,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.12.10#'Tis sure the mighty will revenge at last."
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.12.11#To whom Pelides:--"From thy inmost soul
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.12.12#Speak what thou know'st, and speak without control.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.12.13#E'en by that god I swear who rules the day,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.12.14#To whom thy hands the vows of Greece convey.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.12.15#And whose bless'd oracles thy lips declare;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.12.16#Long as Achilles breathes this vital air,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.12.17#No daring Greek, of all the numerous band,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.12.18#Against his priest shall lift an impious hand;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.12.19#Not e'en the chief by whom our hosts are led,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.12.20#The king of kings, shall touch that sacred head."
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.13.1#Encouraged thus, the blameless man replies:
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.13.2#"Nor vows unpaid, nor slighted sacrifice,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.13.3#But he, our chief, provoked the raging pest,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.13.4#Apollo's vengeance for his injured priest.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.13.5#Nor will the god's awaken'd fury cease,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.13.6#But plagues shall spread, and funeral fires increase,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.13.7#Till the great king, without a ransom paid,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.13.8#To her own Chrysa send the black-eyed maid.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.13.9#Perhaps, with added sacrifice and prayer,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.13.10#The priest may pardon, and the god may spare."
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.14.1#The prophet spoke: when with a gloomy frown
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.14.2#The monarch started from his shining throne;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.14.3#Black choler fill'd his breast that boil'd with ire,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.14.4#And from his eye-balls flash'd the living fire:
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.14.5#"Augur accursed! denouncing mischief still,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.14.6#Prophet of plagues, for ever boding ill!
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.14.7#Still must that tongue some wounding message bring,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.14.8#And still thy priestly pride provoke thy king?
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.14.9#For this are Phoebus' oracles explored,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.14.10#To teach the Greeks to murmur at their lord?
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.14.11#For this with falsehood is my honour stain'd,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.14.12#Is heaven offended, and a priest profaned;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.14.13#Because my prize, my beauteous maid, I hold,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.14.14#And heavenly charms prefer to proffer'd gold?
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.14.15#A maid, unmatch'd in manners as in face,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.14.16#Skill'd in each art, and crown'd with every grace;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.14.17#Not half so dear were Clytaemnestra's charms,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.14.18#When first her blooming beauties bless'd my arms.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.14.19#Yet, if the gods demand her, let her sail;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.14.20#Our cares are only for the public weal:
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.14.21#Let me be deem'd the hateful cause of all,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.14.22#And suffer, rather than my people fall.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.14.23#The prize, the beauteous prize, I will resign,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.14.24#So dearly valued, and so justly mine.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.14.25#But since for common good I yield the fair,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.14.26#My private loss let grateful Greece repair;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.14.27#Nor unrewarded let your prince complain,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.14.28#That he alone has fought and bled in vain."
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.14.29#"Insatiate king (Achilles thus replies),
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.14.30#Fond of the power, but fonder of the prize!
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.14.31#Would'st thou the Greeks their lawful prey should yield,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.14.32#The due reward of many a well-fought field?
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.15.1#The spoils of cities razed and warriors slain,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.15.2#We share with justice, as with toil we gain;
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.15.3#But to resume whate'er thy avarice craves
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.15.4#(That trick of tyrants) may be borne by slaves.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.15.5#Yet if our chief for plunder only fight,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.15.6#The spoils of Ilion shall thy loss requite,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.15.7#Whene'er, by Jove's decree, our conquering powers
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.15.8#Shall humble to the dust her lofty towers."
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.16.1#Then thus the king: "Shall I my prize resign
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.16.2#With tame content, and thou possess'd of thine?

urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.16.5#At thy demand shall I restore the maid?
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.16.6#First let the just equivalent be paid;

urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.16.16#We launch a bark to plough the watery plains,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.16.17#And waft the sacrifice to Chrysa's shores,
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.16.18#With chosen pilots, and with labouring oars.
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.16.19#Soon shall the fair the sable ship ascend,

urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.17.1#At this, Pelides, frowning stern, replied:

urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.59.5#Meantime the radiant sun to mortal sight
urn:cts:fufolio:pope.iliad.fu2019:1.59.6#Descending swift, roll'd down the rapid light:
